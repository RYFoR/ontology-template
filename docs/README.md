## Use Cases

While the Sample Ontology is intentionally basic, ontologies play a crucial role in various applications and industries:

- **Semantic Web**: Ontologies enable the semantic web by providing a standardized way to describe data and knowledge, facilitating data integration and interoperability.

- **Knowledge Management**: Organizations use ontologies to structure and categorize their knowledge assets, improving information retrieval and decision-making.

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Ontologies are essential for AI applications, including natural language processing, recommendation systems, and expert systems.

- **Bioinformatics**: In bioinformatics, ontologies help annotate and integrate biological data, supporting research and discovery.
